<p>In logic there are deductively correct statements given specific premises (so has been claimed, at least). However, art deals with arbitrary semantic groupings that meaningfully affect our reaction to said phenomena--it is so because we think it is so, basically. These notions are heavily (ONLY, actually) contextually founded, so any generalized "rule" is actually quite useless without that intermediary knowledge of how to "unfold" it into more specific application. So it really doesn't compress at all. Come to think of it, I've said this before: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess the problem is that these [fundamentals], while seemingly (and are, in certain manners) conceptually simple, have many considerations that must be made and do not even come close to expressing the real "matrix" of information that would have to be learned to become strong in any one of these. It's approaching something like saying, "in order to be a good artist it's important to make good art," really.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That came from more of an observed/experiential perspective. Which convinces me more since you should get back to the same place about the same thing from different angles if that conclusion is right.</p>
<p>Anyhow the more intelligible way to say this is that art ability comes from experience and contextual knowledge, and engineer-y types that try to do artistic stuff usually get stuck in the mindset of trying to abide by a collection of rules that aren't general enough to actually be true. Recently I saw a video of someone analyzing the title designs of steam capsules where they said something to the effect of, "it's better to make the first and last letter bigger than the others". Although that does.. sometimes correlate with the overall competency of the design, most artists would tacitly understand that this is a surface-level conclusion. Even something as specific and isolated as making a technically competent title wordmark design thing doesn't have really have any hard commandments to it. </p>
<p>Not that anyone is always immune to it. I do see artists fall into this, and I have done so as well. But the notion of hard rules is something that has to be discarded for art.</p>
<p>One must vibe!</p>
