<p>Despite many billions of dollars collectively thrown at the problem, "AI" remains stubbornly uncreative. A version of Google's Gemini did score at a gold medal level for the 2025 math olympiad, though <a href="https://epoch.ai/gradient-updates/we-didnt-learn-much-from-the-imo">its significance is contested,</a> naturally. In any case, it's clear that the conventional approach isn't enough to crack the code on generating something interesting or new. 
This is particularly the case in art. It certainly makes a strong case for human creativity existing at some magnitude higher than a conglomeration of data, though I wouldn't say that was an immediately evident conclusion at all. </p>
<p>I had some vague thought that AI don't have individualistic views and experiences to the extent that humans do, and maybe that would give its output more personality.. but there is a chasmic difference in the output from a competent artist and AI given a more specific and "interesting" prompt anyhow, so presumably that wouldn't be enough.</p>
