<p>The first widely recognized "microtransaction" was a horse armor dlc for Oblivion in 2006. Anyone familiar with games knows how that's since influenced the industry. But whose fault was that? The case can be made for casinos or even gacha/loot boxes in games abusing our brains' wiring, but at some point in between surely there needs to be some consumer responsibility for buying dumb things..</p>
