<p>Is there any field where a healthy dose of self-delusion isn't useful? </p>
<p>inflated sense of one's own abilities to do something is a particularly negative thing.Obviously in areas with limited amounts of meritocracy It could lead to some embarassment. </p>
<p>It's well established in sports that when someone breaks a significant milestone, like the four minute mile barrier, there's often several people that will follow the record shortly after. Clearly perception about the feasibility of a task plays a large role in whether people are able to do it or not. Aren't we putting ceilings on ourselves constantly, preemptively?  </p>

<pre><code>- given how accomplishment in basically any field requires quite a bit of persistence, and some fields particularly so, it makes me wonder if there is a significant missing trait that doesn't pair well with the capacity for "persistence" in the population that doesn't persist..
