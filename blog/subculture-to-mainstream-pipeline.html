<p>What's always been interesting to me is how certain sub- and countercultures consistently have their aesthetics picked up as something trendy by a broader audience. One example is larger internet culture and 4chan-isms: rickrolling, lolcats, trollface, Pepe, soyjacks, "bait", "-slop", "-pilled", to name a few. Similarly "young people slang" in America seems to be largely downstream of Black culture--"being 'extra'", "capping," "drip", "bet", "sus", the list is endless here as well. One last one is how skateboard brand clothing was very popular with teenagers in general around 2018, and maybe it still is. And I'm sure there's countless other examples of this pattern.

I don't know what could cause this other than something like a "big brother effect" on the scale of entire communities, as in these subcultures are seen as cool or authentic (creative?) to outsiders which inclines them to imitation.</p>
