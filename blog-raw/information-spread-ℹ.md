Something that I wouldn't have guessed before we had tools that enabled instant communication is how long it would take new reputable information to reach some level of general awareness online. Often controversies and other ugly facts languish for years in a gray area where people who follow the space more closely are aware of it before it's finally pushed into broader public knowledge. I suppose it must be a question of limited interest on the public's end.. In fairness continually having to reevaluate your vague endorsement of some thing based on some random new controversy can quickly become tiresome.
