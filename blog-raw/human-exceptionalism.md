Despite many billions of dollars collectively thrown at the problem, AI remains stubbornly "uncreative". A version of Google's Gemini did score at a gold medal level for the 2025 math olympiad, though [its significance is contested,](https://epoch.ai/gradient-updates/we-didnt-learn-much-from-the-imo) naturally. In any case, it's clear that the conventional approach isn't enough to crack the code on generating something interesting or new. 
This is particularly the case in art. It certainly makes a strong case for human creativity existing at some magnitude higher than a conglomeration of data, though I wouldn't say that was an immediately evident conclusion at all. 

I had the vague thought that AI don't have individualistic views and experiences to the extent that humans do, and maybe that would give its output more personality.. but there is a chasmic difference in the output from a competent artist and AI given a more specific and "interesting" prompt anyhow, so presumably that wouldn't be enough.
