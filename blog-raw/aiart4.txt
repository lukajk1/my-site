Assuming AI is incorporated into at least most creative industry pipelines at some point, I expect that we will see a lot more deviation from convention in visual media. Or any artistic discipline, really. Since gen AI as it currently works is derivative of its training data, pioneering new styles is a simple enough means of demonstrating individuality.
