"persistenceness" comes down to 
- response to failure (can change with a varying amount of effort)
- external pressures (family, immediate social groups (teammates, friends) societal (imagined or otherwise, well isn't it always imagined because it just depends on whether that particular one resonates and is internalized by the individual or not))
- how strong one's sense of purpose/belief in what they are doing is
	- probably not the most relevant factor on a day-to-day basis?
- intrinsic interest in the subject
- hyperfixative/addictive tendency, of either the person, the activity, or both

"Laziness" doesn't exist as a distinct trait. It's just a lack of one or more of those four aspects. Unless you're depressed

Extreme workaholics seem like they tend to be mostly motivated by a strong sense of purpose and maybe some sort of external pressure (such and such is counting on me, etc)
