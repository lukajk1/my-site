aren't we already at the point where we are fully reliant on technology to keep the world going? If a large portion of computer systems were to spontaneously fail tomorrow I'm pretty sure there would be a lot of chaos. I suppose the difference in this future where computers have solved the major practical problems for us is that these systems could have more intelligence and individual autonomy. Much closer to agents than the ultimately inert systems we use today.
