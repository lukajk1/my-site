Seems like half the posts on this blog are about ai. In my defense it does seem to be permanently topical these days..

Unless there's some sort of imminent massive computing power boom programs will still need to be (somewhat, relatively) intelligent with their resources, and hence run on fairly constrained and optimized grounds. This inherent need to allocate resources can get quite technical in nature and naturally the best way to structure instructions and management of constraints is through some sort of rigorous instructions--code. So understanding of programming is likely not going anywhere. An entirely non-technical person is not going to be able to produce a performant or likely functioning-at-all shopify clone in half a week. But I do wonder how much ai can faciliate already strong programmers. I wouldn't know since I'm not one (lol).
