Expertise is only informed by knowledge, but at the same time we've all been exposed to enough to the point where we should really be able to catch on to some patterns and learn 'new' things more efficiently. I guess there's the aspect of forgetting some pithy idea that would illuminate some crucial connections or another. And what are you supposed to do exactly in its absence? Nothing for it but just to try I suppose.
